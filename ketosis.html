	<h2 id="ketosis">Ketosis</h2>
	<p>Watched a video of someone’s 7-day fast and I'm feeling inspired and intrigued. I’ve watched/read about a few people’s multi-day fasts and they all talk about a period ~2 days after starting the fast where they no longer feel hungry or tired.</p>
	<p>I think the scientific explanation for this is a combination of ghrelin levels decreasing and the body entering ketosis which helps with energy levels.</p>
	<p>I’ve heard this stage of fasting be described as almost euphoric. Would like to give this a go and document the process. Will find some time in the new year.</p></div>

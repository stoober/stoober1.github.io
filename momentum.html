	<h2 id="momentum">Momentum</h2>
	<p>Momentum is the biggest contributor to consistency and habit adherence in my experience. Building continuous streaks, especially when progress is visible, makes it significantly easier to stay disciplined with behaviors that contribute to long-term goals.</p>
	<p>Major life shifts are often good catalysts for behavior change, but can also disrupt any built-up momentum. My semester just ended and moving back home has taken away my schedule and sense of routine. Going to spend the next few days building it back up.</p></div>

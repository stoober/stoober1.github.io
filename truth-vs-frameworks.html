	<p>There are times where thinking about something a certain way (a framework for thinking) is useful, even if it’s not necessarily true. An example of this is the growth mindset. It’s less important whether or not intelligence is fixed—rather, the value of having a growth mindset comes from <em>believing</em> that you can improve through intentional effort.</p>
	<p>Another example is the law of attraction. I don’t believe that just thinking about things will make them happen, but I think there is value in being ruthlessly focused on your goals. Having that mindset will open your eyes to opportunities to achieve your goals that you otherwise would not see.</p>
	<p>Another example is choosing your personality. Some people like to say our personalities are fixed. Maybe this is true, but choosing to believe otherwise and acting accordingly broadens what you think you are able to do.</p>
	<p>There are many things in life that we can’t know the answer to. Instead of searching for the answer, it’s sometimes better to find ways of thinking that expand what we are capable of.</p></div>

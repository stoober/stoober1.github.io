	<p>The past 4 weeks, I have been experimenting with different routines. Specifically, trying to find the optimal times for waking up, working out, doing important work, eating, and doing less important work.</p>
	<p>I’m still not sure what works best, but here are some of the things I’ve learned:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Waking up early (before 8am for me) is ambiguous but waking up late (after 9am) is definitely bad. By the time I start doing actual things, it feels like half the day has gone by which is kind of depressing.</li>
	<li>I don’t need to eat breakfast, and maybe lunch as well. Haven’t been a consistent breakfast eater for over 5 years now. I’m not hungry when I wake up and function fine without food. I usually get hungry around 11-12, but I’ve found that eating a small lunch is good for energy levels. Except sometimes I get really hungry—not sure how this works.</li>
	<li>Gym in the morning feels good, but I’m not sure if it’s optimal. Working out in the morning is a good way to feel like I’ve accomplished something early on. However, I think my most effective hours are before noon so working out then seems like a waste of this time. I’ve tried working out a night in the past but found it very tiring. Might have to give it another go.</li>
	<li>It’s hard to get anything done after 9pm.</li>
	<li>A coffee ritual is unecessary, but fun.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I’m most interested in optimizing the right tasks for the right times. How can I structure my day so my best hours are spent on the most important things? What needs to get done before to prepare me? What can I do to maintain my level of energy? When is the best time to do less important things?</p></div>

	<h2 id="spontaneity">Spontaneity</h2>
	<p>I am writing this a bit after my friend and I made a very spontaneous decision to go to NYC tomorrow morning.</p>
	<p>Spontaneity feels great because it expands our box of possible experience. When we do things on a whim, without thinking too hard and before the voice in our head can stop us, we have experiences that push the boundaries of what we consider reasonable. We can trick ourselves into doing things we didn’t think we could do.</p>
	<p>Too much thinking and planning turns interesting ideas into unmade decisions. I propose we all become 1% more spontaneous. Do the thing and regret it instead of patting yourself on the back for avoiding a mistake.</p></div>

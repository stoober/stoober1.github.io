	<h2 id="postcollege">Post-college</h2>
	<p>It’s interesting to see how being in a different stage of life changes your values and experiences. It’s common to hear that college is a time like no other when it comes to your social life. You will (supposedly) never be in an environment filled with similar aged people with so much free time and serendipitous interaction.</p>
	<p>Post-college social life is something I’m excited, but also apprehensive about. I like the concept of being more in control of my living situation—location especially—and also look forward to exiting the “bubble” of school.</p>
	<p>I think a lot about where I should live after graduation. Most of the advice I’ve gotten boils down to “go to NYC, SF, or LA.” People tell me I can’t go wrong with any of the three, but I still can’t help but obsess over the details. I know they are probably right, but that doesn’t mean the experience will be the same in all three cities.</p></div>

	<h2>Publish</h2>
	
	<p>A daily publishing habit is something I’ve been interested in for a while, but always felt it wasn’t feasible for me. I understand and even shill to others the virtues of writing consistently, but feel a tremendous resistance to publishing every day.</p>
	<p>For the past few weeks, I’ve been doing <a href="https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/">morning pages</a>—it’s a nice way to “clear the cache” in my brain, but I think writing to publish is a different challenge. When you write something that is meant for other people to see, there is an expectation of coherence and value.</p>
	<p>My morning pages are, for the most part, neither. With this new experiment, I’m excited to try and develop more intelligibility with my thoughts. I want to be able to have and share a new idea every day. I guess that’s today’s idea. Writing is good, but publishing is a practice in clarity.</p>
	<p>Some inspirations for this experiment:</p>

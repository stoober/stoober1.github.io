	<h2 id="serial">Serial</h2>
	<p>Finally got around to listening to <a href="https://serialpodcast.org/">Serial</a>. I’m not a podcast historian, but I think Serial is the podcast that made podcasts go mainstream. The style of the show, a 12 episode investigative journalism piece, has been replicated many times since 2014. It’s interesting to see how Serial was the one to set the tone for an entire category of podcasts.</p>
	<p>I wonder what novel podcast structures are waiting to be discovered. It seems like besides the Serial-style shows, we have interview shows (<a href="https://tim.blog/">Tim Ferriss</a>, <a href="https://www.joerogan.com/">Joe Rogan</a>), group conversation shows (<a href="https://www.allinpodcast.co/">All-in</a>, <a href="https://crooked.com/podcast-series/pod-save-america/">Pod Save America</a>), and two hosts exploring something shows (<a href="https://radiolab.org/">Radiolab</a>, <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all">Reply All</a>) as the main formats.</p>
	<p>I’m interested in formats that engage audiences in new ways. Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces are interesting first iterations on this idea. Video also looks like a trend that podcasts are heading towards, though I think there is something qualitatively different with the audio-only experience. A big part of it might be that audio-only lets you do other things while listening.</p>
	<p>I’m also increasingly becoming a fan of solo-host audio essay type podcasts (<a href="https://www.httotw.com/">How To Take Over The World</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CeceXie">Currently Workshopping</a> stand out as good ones right now). The format gives the host a lot of freedom to explore their own ideas. Kinda like an audio version of Substack.</p></div>

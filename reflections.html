	<h2 id="reflecting">Reflections</h2>
	<p>I’ve been reading a lot of 2022 reflections lately. As a genre, I enjoy seeing how people evaluate how the past 12 months went and plan for the next 12. I’m not sold on the effectiveness of reviews—mostly because my goals and values usually change drastically over the course of the year. Part of that might be because I’m fairly young and things change so fast.</p>
	<p>Regardless, I’d like to try to conduct a yearly review of my own. I think a good starting place is to craft a list of questions to ask myself and reflect on. Here are some good ones I’ve seen in other people’s reviews:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>What do you hope will be different a year from now? The same?</li>
	<li>What did you do this year that you’d never done before?</li>
	<li>What days from this year will remain etched upon your memory?</li>
	<li>What did you get really, really, really excited about?</li>
	<li>What did you want and get? </li>
	<li>What did you want and not get?</li>
	<li>What things brought the most energy and joy?</li>
	<li>What things were the biggest energy drainers?</li>
	</ul></div>

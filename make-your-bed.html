	<h2 id="makeyourbed">Make your bed</h2>
	<p>Been thinking about <a href="https://eliqian.xyz/grit-and-priorities">grit</a> a lot lately. What I wrote previously was wrong. Grit really just is the ability to put in the work, even when you don’t feel emotionally attached to the outcome (ie motivated). </p>
	<p>Watching and listening to Kobe Bryant talk about his work ethic was eye-opening. I feel like I lack his “mamba mentality” in life. I admire his seemingly inhuman ability to continue putting in the work despite suboptimal conditions. This man can be sick, operating on 4 hours of sleep, and still drop a 40-piece on your head. He will do things simply because they are hard, and he wants to prove to himself he can do it.</p>
	<p>The title of this post is make your bed because I finally realized I’ve been thinking about that concept wrong my whole life. Two weeks ago, I thought the advice to make your bed every morning was one of the dumbest things ever. My reasoning was that 1) no one except me sees my bed and 2) I don’t care if it’s made or not. </p>
	<p>It didn’t help that common justifications for making your bed were along the lines of “it keeps your living space organized” or “reduces clutter and chaos in your life.” The real reason to make your bed is that it forces you to do something you don’t really want to do.</p>
	<p>Hardly Kobe levels of mamba mentality, I know. But it is a new way to think about the concept of making your bed. Do it <em>because</em> you don’t want to.</p></div>

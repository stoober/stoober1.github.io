	<h2 id="recurringconversation">Recurring conversation</h2>
	<p>I have a few recurring conversations in my life. Every week, I get together with my two best friends to record an episode of <a href="https://minimallyedited.com/">our podcast</a>. It’s a way for us to stay in touch and work collectively on a project.</p>
	<p>I have a biweekly (every other week) brunch with another friend who goes to school nearby. We were close in high school and getting food twice a month makes me feel like we are still a part of each other’s lives.</p>
	<p>I also have a weekly video call with an internet friend I met on Farcaster. We talk for about an hour every time and I always leave the conversation with new ideas.</p>
	<p>Without these commitments, friendships can easily disappear. One of my <a href="https://catapult.co/stories/the-families-we-choose">favorite essays</a> is about the unique nature of friendships compared to family or romantic relationships:</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <em>There is no external structure that compels us to keep up friendships when they are inconvenient. The closest friendships, the ones that feel like family, can end in a slow and undramatic muttering, with no defining event or explanation, until the word “friend” means “someone I used to know.” We depict friendships as an escape from rigorous relationships, forgetting that love itself is a form of rigor. Maintaining any type of meaningful relationship requires a daily reckoning with ourselves and with our obligations to others.</em>
	</blockquote>
	<p>I’d like to have more recurring conversations, especially with some of my internet friends that I otherwise wouldn’t get a chance to interact with. It doesn’t have to be every week, or even every month. But having a slot in the calendar is a commitment from both people to keep the other in their life. </p></div>

	<p>I originally shared <a href="farcaster://casts/0x605f1c32815874a35e612403765fd78a105f51e5972478f926cd1e9bca815aa3/0x605f1c32815874a35e612403765fd78a105f51e5972478f926cd1e9bca815aa3">this thought</a> on Farcaster, but since I now have a mailing list (with real people subscribed!) I thought it would be worth writing about again.</p>
	<p>For movies, books, and music, there are products/services/structures that exist to facilitate discussion about them. For example, we have YouTube channels dedicated to analyzing films, subreddits and threads dedicated to discussing albums, and book clubs to dive deeper into the ideas from books.</p>
	<p>However, I haven’t found the equivalent for podcasts and it’s truly a shame. Podcasts are filled with interesting and insightful ideas that invite further discussion, but there isn’t a good way to actually have those discussions. </p>
	<p>Part of the issue might be that there are just so many podcast episodes that it’s hard to keep up. But this seems like a cop-out excuse. I’m sure many people who listen to thoughtful podcasts would appreciate a forum to explore the ideas they hear about, even if it isn’t for every episode.</p>
	<p><strong>My proposed solution to this is a podcast about a podcast.</strong> An entire show dedicated to discussing episodes of another show. Sounds crazy but I think this could work. Maybe not only discussing episodes from a single show, but the most interesting episodes from a variety of shows.</p>
	<p>Quick plug: I actually tried this out with some friends but ended up pivoting to a different kind of show. You can listen to our podcast here, it’s called <a href="https://minimallyedited.com/"><em>Minimally Edited</em></a>.</p>
	<p>I’m still open to the idea of this so if anyone is interested in trying it out (even for a single episode!) please let me know.</p></div>

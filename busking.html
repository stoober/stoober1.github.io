	<p>Was watching videos of subway performances on YouTube a while back and it got me thinking about unrealized talent. </p>
	<p>There is a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/pearls-before-breakfast-can-one-of-the-nations-great-musicians-cut-through-the-fog-of-a-dc-rush-hour-lets-find-out/2014/09/23/8a6d46da-4331-11e4-b47c-f5889e061e5f_story.html">famous story</a> where Joshua Bell, a renowned violinist, busked in the subway. The theater he played at a few days before was sold out. Barely anyone stopped to listen in the subway.</p>
	<p>The world is filled with interesting, talented people. Some of them are well-known but most are not. But the coolest thing is that many unrecognized talents are still out there creating amazing things for other people to see.</p>
	<p>Some questions that would be valuable to think about and work on:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>How can we better find and identify talent?</li>
	<li>How can we give unrecognized talent the tools to accomplish things on a bigger scale?</li>
	<li>What will the world look like when distribution of ideas becomes infinite and ubiquitous?</li>
	</ul></div>

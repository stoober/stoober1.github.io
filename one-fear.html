		<h2 id="onefear">One fear</h2>
		<p>One fear I have related to this daily writing experiment is that it will discourage me from diving deeper into interesting topics. On <a href="https://eliqian.substack.com/">substack</a>, I want to write thoughtful, long-form pieces that resonate with people and help them articulate ideas they’ve been grappling with. </p>
		<p>For every piece that gets published, there are dozens of ideas that remain unfinished or abandoned. If I publish a short piece here, will that reduce the urgency to craft a more examined and (hopefully) insightful essay?</p>
		<p>One of my motivations for writing long-form essays is because there are some topics that I can’t stop thinking about. I talk about them with my friends, think about them in the shower, and craft imaginary speeches to give to an imaginary audience. Writing is a good way to finally articulate and share those thoughts.</p>
		<p>Short pieces accomplish 90% of that, but don’t force me to scrutinize and form insights that only come from writing thousands of words. I don’t think that’s a tradeoff I want to make.</p></div>

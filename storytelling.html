	<h2 id="publish">Storytelling</h2>
	<p>I just started listening to <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/podcasts/trojan-horse-affair.html">The Trojan Horse Affair</a></em>, and it’s reminded me why I love storytelling. What I like most about <em>The Trojan Horse Affair</em> is the concept of looking at an event that happened and asking obvious questions that don’t have clear answers.</p>
	<p>The coolest thing is that we can find stories that are just as interesting in our lives, but it takes a willingness and level of patience to not be satisfied with the first answer we find. </p>
	<p>Some ideas off the top of my head:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>How does the hotel near my school make money? Seems like there isn’t enough traffic for it to be profitable</li>
	<li>It would be cool to follow the life of a kid who attends a tennis academy and see what it’s like to live and breathe a single activity</li>
	<li>Why is Philly’s waterfront so bad compared to other major cities on the East Coast?</li>
	<li>What’s the deal with Michael Schulson? I’m a big fan of his restaurants (Sampan especially), but I’ve read things on Reddit that he is a “total asshole” and his company is super toxic</li>
	</ul></div>

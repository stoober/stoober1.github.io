	<h2 id="deepokayness">Deep okayness</h2>
	<p>I think I had a moment of deep okayness earlier today. It was nighttime, raining, and cold. I was walking back from the gym—freezing, shoes soaked, and overall very uncomfortable. But despite this, I didn’t have any contempt or frustration. I was just listening to some Christmas music and accepting the rain and discomfort. It wasn’t necessarily an enjoyable experience, but I felt okay and at ease the whole walk back. </p>
	<p>Is this what people mean by a sense of deep okayness? An acceptance and calmness about whatever happens in life? It would be cool to live through life with this attitude and reaction to things that don’t go my way.</p></div>

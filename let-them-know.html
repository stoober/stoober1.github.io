	<h2 id="letthemknow">Let them know</h2>
	<p>This past summer, I came across a rule that I can legit say has changed my life. It’s from <a href="https://twitter.com/p_millerd">Paul Millerd</a>:</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <em>Any time I consume something from an individual that inspires me, I have to send them a note to let them know. Creating and sharing in public takes an incredible amount of courage and I remember how awkward and scared I was at the beginning of my journey.</em>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Some things I’ve learned from doing this:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>People are way more accessible than you think. Telling someone you read their writing seems to resonate with people and make them more willing to talk to you.</li>
	<li>Most people are down to make friends on the internet. Finding “your people” seems to be a difficult life problem, and limiting yourself by geography makes it even harder. Many of the people I follow on Twitter were more than happy to have a conversation and keep in touch.</li>
	<li>Writing online makes your footprint on the world bigger. There are people, like myself, who like to reach out to other people who write interesting things. Publishing your thoughts is how you cultivate those connections.</li>
	<li>Meeting people has expanded my conception of what is possible. Among my IRL friends, there isn’t a lot of diversity in terms of what people want to do in life. On the internet, there are people pursuing things I never imagined were possible life paths.</li>
	</ul></div>

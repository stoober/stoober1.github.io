<h2>What is this?</h2>
  <p>To harness the power of public shaming and accountability, I'm publicizing my goal and putting money on the line. Help me acheive my goal of body recomposition by participating in this project. All you need is an Ethereum wallet.</p>

<h2>How does this work?</h2>
  <p>To participate, you need to mint my Body Recomp Challenge NFT. It is free to mint, you only need to pay for gas. If you're new to crypto, send me a message and I'll help you get setup and send you some crypto to get started.</p>
  <p>If I don't acheive my goal, I will be paying out a prize to all NFT holders. If I do acheive my goal, I will not be paying anyone anything, but you will always get to keep your commemorative NFT.</p>

<h2>What are the success/fail conditions?</h2>
  <p>The conditions are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>be greater than or equal to 162 pounds</li>
  	<li>be less than or equal to 12.5% body fat</li>
  	<li>acheive the above conditions by November 21, 2022 <em>Note: if I acheive the conditions before Nov 21, the challenge is over and I succeed</em></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Measurements will be recorded by my Renpho scale I bought on Amazon. In order for a measurement to be valid, it must be done on the same scale I measured my initla weight and body fat with.</p>
  <p>I will be updating my measurements on this website as often as I weigh myself. I try to do so every day. If you don't see an update for a while, feel free to bug me.</p>

  <h2>What's the prize?</h2>
    <p>Any one who participates can keep the challenge NFT and do what they want with it. In the event I fail, I will pay out 0.01 ETH (~$14 USD at the time of writing) to wallets that hold the challenge NFT. There are only 25 challenge NFTs available for mint and a maximum of one mint per address. You can trade the NFT as you wish, but if you do so on Zora, I will receive a 50% commission.</p>

  <h2>How do I buy one?</h2>
    <p>To participate, grab your challenge NFT <a href="https://create.zora.co/collections/0x5337663fff39f3ff650cb40dfeb0f7c6e60d3ee6 ">here</a>.</p>
